# f1tenth_code
This repo contains all custom code (i.e. not including libraries/packages necessary but can be obtained when installing ROS and other dependencies) that is on the NVIDIA Jetson TK1.

We keep the custom ROS packages in a default directory: catkin_ws

An additional file of Arduino code is included. This is the Teensyduino’s firmware and can be loaded using Arduino IDE.
